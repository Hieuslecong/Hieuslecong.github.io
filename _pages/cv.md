Education
======

* **M.S.** Mechatronics in *VNU University of Engineering and Technology* (VNU-UET), 2024
* **B.Eng.** Mechanical Engineering in *VNU University of Engineering and Technology* (VNU-UET) 2018

Work experience
======
* **Research Assistant**, Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology(AVITECH), Oct/2023-Current
  * **GAN-based image generation for crack detection:** This project involves using simulated cracks to train a GANs model, aiming to generate artificial image datasets for reconstructing Deep Learning models. The goal is to enhance these models by incorporating artificial cracks, potentially improving their performance compared to real cracks. This section employs a GANs model (PIX2PIXHD, DP-Gan, OASIS) and relevant Deep Learning libraries.

* **Research assistant**, *[Dr.Tran Hiep Dinh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tran-hiep-dinh/)'s research group*, Jul/2019 - Current
  * **Crack Detection:** In this project, I focused on noise types for Deep Learning algorithms and used regression models from Machine Learning to detect changes in direction. Besides, the project correlates the simulated crack (generated from the theory of damage mechanics and simulated in Abaqus) with the actual crack. Taking advantage of Matlab and Python, I use support libraries such as OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
  * **Social distancing monitoring:** This project uses multiple cameras to measure the distance between
  individuals in crowded areas. Object detection models and social distancing metrics are analyzed to provide
  timely warning for violence cases.
  * **Correlation between F1-score and region contrast:** This project evaluates the correlation between an
  objective (F1-score) and a subjective metric (region contrast) in crack segmentation applications. The
  goal is to develop a segmentation evaluation metric that performs better than the current contrast without
  depending on human annotation.
